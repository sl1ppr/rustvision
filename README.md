## 🛡️ Security & Anti-Cheat Safety

RustVision is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible, making it safe for use with various anti-cheat systems (EAC, BattlEye, etc.):

* **No Hooks:** Does not interact with or hook into DirectX, Vulkan, or OpenGL.
* **No DLL Injection:** Operates strictly as a standalone process.
* **External Operation:** Adjusts gamma at the system/display level rather than modifying game memory.

## ✨ Features

* **On-the-fly Adjustment:** Change gamma settings instantly without restarting your game.
* **Customizable:** Manually change the target process name to support any game.
* **Minimal Footprint:** Extremely low CPU and RAM usage.
